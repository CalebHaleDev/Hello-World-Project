# Overview

This program displays the message "Hello World" when ran. In future projects the console display could be used for more useful feedback for debugging, informing the user of data, or even making character-based displays. I have created this program to merely print "Hello World" to the console and practice uploading files to Github, and otherwise warm-up and make sure I know how to create and handle files for future projects.

Here is a one minute demo of the software and a walkthrough of the code:

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to create this program, using the programming language C++.
C++ uses the sytax cout << "words"; to print words to the console.
